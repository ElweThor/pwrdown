This is a **symlink** (not a real file) you'll have to add (by hand), into this directory, to point to the *current* utility release: every time you make a new version, the symlink pointer have to be updated, to point to the (new) current shell script, 'cause the system will reference (this) "pwrdown_current" symlink, not your shell script directly.

This is made to avoid having to change various source files, to keep them up to date with changing versions: just update the symlink and all will work.
